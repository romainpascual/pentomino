### Pentomino problem
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentomino

# Problem

We have 12 shapes called pentominos, made of 5 cells, that we want to arrange on a 60-cell grid with no overlap. The shapes can be rotated or flipped.
We want to draw a solution and give the total number of solutions, excluding trivial variations obtained by rotation and reflection of the whole rectangle.
